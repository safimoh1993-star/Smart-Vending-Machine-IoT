# 🚨 Smart Vending Machine – IoT Project

A Smart Vending Machine designed and built by **high school students** under the supervision of **Teacher Safia Mohammed Al-Qarni** for the *Internet of Things (IoT)* course.  

The system uses **RFID technology**: when the user scans their card, they can enter the product number on a **keypad**, and the corresponding **servo motor** releases the selected item.  

🎥 *A demo video is included in this repository — proud of my students’ creativity and teamwork!* 💚

## ⚙️ Components
| Component | Function |
|-----------|---------|
| Arduino UNO | Main microcontroller |
| LCD Display | Shows instructions and product selection |
| 4 Servo Motors | Dispenses the selected products |
| RFID Reader | Identifies authorized users |
| Keypad | For product number input |
| Breadboard & Jumper Wires | Circuit connections |

---

## 💡 How It Works
1. User scans RFID card.  
2. User enters the desired product number on the keypad.  
3. Arduino controls the corresponding servo motor to release the product.  
4. LCD displays instructions and status messages in real-time.

## 💻 Code File
All Arduino logic is included in **[SmartVending.ino](https://github.com/safimoh1993-star/Smart-Vending-Machine-IoT/blob/main/SmartVending.ino)**.  
The code is written in **C++** and can be simulated using **Tinkercad Circuits** or implemented on a physical prototype.
